# Undergrad

I completed a Bachelor of Computing: Software Engineering from a specialized IT university, where I acquired in-depth knowledge and practical experience in software design, development, and testing methodologies.

Here I describe some of the different projects I completed as part of the undergrad as well as some concepts I learnt along the way.
