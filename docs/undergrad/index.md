I completed a **Bachelor of Computing: Software Engineering** from  Belgium Campus, a university specializing in IT, where I acquired in-depth knowledge and practical experience in software design, development, and testing methodologies.

Here I describe some of the different projects I completed as part of the undergrad as well as some concepts I learnt along the way.
