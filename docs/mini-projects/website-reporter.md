#Website (WHOIS) Reporter

This project is focused on developing a program that showcases the use of multiple external libraries to form a coherent project.

Form the given ip the program makes use of the WHOIS client library to collect all of the data of an IP.

The program then also makes use of the MIT QRCoder library to generate a QR code of the IP.

And finally the program makes use of the Alx Screenshot library to produce a basic html screenshot of the website if one exists.
