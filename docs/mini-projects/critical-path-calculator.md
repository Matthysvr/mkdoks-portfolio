#Critical Path Calculator

This project is focused on developing a program that that can find the critical path for tasks in a project, using the duration and predecessors.
The program can also generate a diagram do demonstrate the workflow.

This project is still a work in progress as I would like to improve the diagram generation and add functionalities such as project crashing and resource management.
